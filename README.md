Welcome to the Termite Neuropeptide Sequences repository!

This dataset focuses on the neuropeptide precursor sequences that we've identified from newly sequenced genomes of 47 Blattodea species. Coveraging of 45 termites, as well as the cockroaches Blatta orientalis and Cryptocercus meridianus, plus Periplaneta americana and Blattella germanica (total: 49 species).

What's in this Repo?

This repository contains neuropeptide precursor sequences, which we retrieved through a few different methods:

   a. Six-frame translations of genomic data from the 47 species.
   b. Representative sequences of these genomic datasets.
   c. As a cross-check and to add more context, we’ve also used transcriptome data where available.

How to Use the Data

Each gene family has its own FASTA file (aligned and reordered based on the phylogeny), which contains sequences relevant to that family. You’ll find sequences grouped by gene family, making it easy to dive into the specific data you're interested in.

The sequences are organized with a specific naming convention. The header of each sequence follows this format:

>Bori_AstCCC

MSAIATTKLMFVMLIAMLTLSWAVGKTLGQPGDKDRLLNELD-LVDDDGSVETALINYLFAKQVVNRLRSQMDVSDLQRKRSYWKQCAFNAVSCFGK

Bori: Species name abbreviation (in this case, Blatta orientalis). A full list of species abbreviations can be found in the Species_name.txt.

AstCCC: Neuropeptide family abbreviation (in this case, AstCCC). A full list of neuropeptide family abbreviations is provided in the Neuropeptide_name.txt.
